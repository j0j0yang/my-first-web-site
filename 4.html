<p>Both Cookie and Haddu love wet cans, Ciao Chuur. <br>
    However, their wet can taste is a <strong>bit different.</strong> <br>
    Cookie likes the taste of Almonature tuna, Wellness tuna shrimp and tuna salmon, and Natural Core tuna crab meat.<br>
    Haddu eats all of the above products, and also eats IMCAT products. <br>
    As for the raw ingredients, Cookie only eats chicken breast, but Hatu does well on shrimp, salmon, beef, and chicken breast.
